Are you constantly experiencing new opportunities? Do you regularly read to learn and grow? Are you open to improving and stretching yourself? The fact that you are reading this demonstrates a certain level of commitment to develop yourself so you are not a 1 or even a 2.',

Although family life should be loving, caring and supportive it often is not for a variety of reasons such as crying babies, wild teenage sons or daughters or constant arguments and tension. These all represent a huge challenge and will affect other areas of your life like your work / studies, relationships and so on. In this respect family life to you could mean a single unit or a more extended family. Whatever family life means to you give yourself a current score',

However you can also decide to score it based on how you interact with people as how often you get to socialise. A vital component of life is the need to get on and interact with people. How comfortable you are in social situations? Some people are the life and soul of every party, loved by all and fully confident yet sensitive whereas others will not want to speak up when there is a group of people around. Give yourself a score. Remember for this one that most 1s are locked up. so you can rule out that score.',

Are you a 1 – you feel physically sick before you go to work each morning (and not because you have been enjoying the festive season too much) or are you a 10 – would you do your job without being paid for it?',
